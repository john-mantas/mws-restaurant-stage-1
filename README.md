# Restaurant Reviews - Stage 1
This **Restaurant Reviews** project, has been converted from a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, this static design lacks accessibility and has been converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use, also there has been added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.
This is a project made for the Udacity Front End developer Nanodegree program.

## Getting Started
In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
